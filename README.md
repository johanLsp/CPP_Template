This is a cross-plateform (Linux/OSX/Windows) CMake based C++ template shipped with :

 - Continuous Integration with Travis CI & Appveyor
 - Unit testing with Catch
 - Documentation with Doxygen
 - Code coverage with CodeCov

Each of these features can be disabled / enabled if needed

## Pre-requisites
You can skip this if you just want to use the CMake template without additional features.
Otherwise, the following dependencies have to be installed :

    doxygen
    boost test-unit-framework
    lcov

## Usage
The template is shipped with extra features disabled. Just clone or fork the repository, and follow the usual CMake build from the project directory :

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
By default, two targets are generated: an executable in bin/, and a library in lib/
The CMake configuration accepts the following options :
- *-DENABLE_DOC=1* : Generates the documentation target
- *-DENABLE_TEST=1* : Turns on testing
- *-DENABLE_COVERAGE=1* : Generates the coverage build




## Features
### Documentation

    cmake -DENABLE_DOC=1 ..
    make doc
Generates the doxygen documentation in doc/html
A base doxygen configuration is provided in [doc/documentation-config.doxygen.in](doc/documentation-config.doxygen.in), along with a few page templates.

### Unit testing
    cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=1 ..
    make test
  Runs the tests defined in [test](test)

### Code Coverage
    cmake -DENABLE_COVERAGE=1 ..
    make test
 Enabling code coverage automatically enables unit testing. Running the test generates a coverage report

### Travis CI
Integration with Travis CI is configured in [.travis.yml](.travis.yml)
The default configuration builds and run tests on different version of Ubuntu & OSX, and generate a coverage report

### Appveyor
Integration with Appveyor is configured in [appveyor.yml](appveyor.yml)
The default configuration builds and run tests on different Visual Studio generators

### CodeCov

Integration with CodeCov is configured in [.codecov.yml](.codecov.yml)
The default Travis configuration automatically push the coverage report to CodeCov.io
